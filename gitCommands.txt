// case one

If someone else modifies the same line in a file you’re working on, a conflict will occur when merging branches. To resolve it:

1-Switch to your branch (not the main branch).

2-Merge the main branch into your branch.

3-Resolve the conflict.

4-Commit the resolved changes.

5-Switch to the main branch.

6-Merge your branch into the main branch again.



// case two

If someone modifies files in the main branch but hasn't committed the changes, an error will occur when switching to another branch.
✅ Solution: Commit or stash the changes in the main branch before switching.
